    <ul>
      <li>Developed a digitization module to do OCR on car RC card for the validation process of used cars which decreased the manual inspection efforts by 79%</li>
      <li>Led a POC to create a car inspection product, successfully built models for car orientation classification, car and car part segmentation, and damage detection using CNN architectures like MaskRCNN, UNET, DeeplabV3, SVM trained on top of HOG features and performed postprocessing like CRF. Achieved an IoU of 0.83 on segmentation task</li>
      <li>Initiated the development of a standard annotation tool for the organization and later deployed it on a server</li>
      <li>Contributed to creating APIs and deploying their DOCKER containers on the server to serve rps of 165</li>
      <li>Co-ordinated with cross-functional teams to make sure smooth incorporation of Data Science solutions</li>
